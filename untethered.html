            <p>My debut album, Untethered, marks the next chapter in my ambient music output. Created entirely with the Roland SH-101 synthesiser and two FX pedals, the album came together in just two weeks, capturing moments of creative flow inspired by a period of self-discovery and experimentation. <br /><br />The music weaves together peaceful soundscapes, playful melodies, textured drones, and hazy arpeggios. Tracks were either performed live in one take, built by layering loops in a generative style, or shaped using the SH-101&rsquo;s onboard arpeggiator. This simple setup was a reaction to the paradox of choice in modern production, which has stifled my output in the past. Stripping back to one instrument allowed me to focus fully on creating and finishing tracks in the moment, avoiding the overworking and endless tinkering that so often dominates contemporary production. <br /><br />The concept for Untethered grew out of a period of self-exploration that left me feeling more in tune with my true nature and the creative forces around me. This album reflects that journey, offering a peaceful and reflective space for listeners to pause and connect. <br /><br />While I&rsquo;ve drawn inspiration from artists like Hiroshi Yoshimura, Boards of Canada, William Basinski, and Brian Eno, this album feels deeply personal and uniquely my own. It&rsquo;s about finding beauty in simplicity and peace in awareness&ndash;with moments of calm and intensity sitting side by side.</p>
