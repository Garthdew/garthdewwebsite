            <h1>Untethered</h1>
            <p>UK-based artist Garth Dew presents Untethered, his debut album and a bold step into experimental, ambient music. Created entirely with the Roland SH-101 synthesiser, the album came together in just two weeks&mdash;a fast and natural process where the ideas flowed effortlessly.</p>
            <p>The record is inspired by two journeys: a time of personal transformation that brought fresh energy and focus to Garth&rsquo;s creativity, and a period of exploration with generative techniques, minimalism, randomness, and play. These approaches kept the process simple and free, avoiding the paradox of choice that comes with modern production and making space for the music to evolve organically.</p>
            <p>The album blends peaceful soundscapes, hypnotic synth patterns, and playful melodies to create a listening experience that is both soothing and intense. The tracks are peaceful and soothing but also have moments of intensity, reflecting the ups and downs of personal growth.</p>
            <p>With Untethered, Garth Dew invites listeners into a calm, reflective space, blending simplicity and experimentation.</p>
