        <h1>Garth Dew - A human being who does projects</h1>
        <p>I am a curious human being in a constant state of evolution and reinvention.
        I spend my time developing creative ideas and projects as they arise. I am not bound by any one noun, medium, genre, or style. I am more of a verb—responding to life, doing stuff, with no concrete plan for where things are heading next.
        What ties my projects together is a desire to experience life fully. Right now, my primary mediums are photography, film, and sound. Tools like the lens and tape recorder heighten my awareness of my internal and external environments. Through them, I capture the people, places, moments, stories, and emotions I encounter.
        I have also run GD Video Ltd for the last decade—a video and photo company developing original and commercial storytelling projects. I have worked with clients such as Neve, Volvo, Speedo, Jaguar Land Rover, Autodesk, Skiddle, and Quorn. My documentaries have been featured on the BBC and at Kendal Mountain.
        In my earlier life, I was a professional rugby player before deciding to pursue a creative life. After completing a music production degree, I worked as a video producer for an international sportswear company. Suffocated by the rigid corporate life, I set out on my own path in 2014. I work and live in Lancashire, UK.</p>
